# A Practical Guide to Writing Copilot Studio Adaptive Dialog YAML (Updated September 2024)

These .yml files are the blueprint for your bot's conversations. They use YAML to define the structure of the conversation and Power Fx to handle the logic.

Think of it like building with LEGOs üß±:

YAML is the set of instructions describing which bricks to use and how they stack on top of each other.

Power Fx is like the programmable motor inside a LEGO Technic piece that makes things happen based on rules and inputs.

## Part 1: The Fundamentals - YAML Syntax

### Rule 1: Indentation is Everything (The Golden Rule)
This is the most important rule in YAML and the source of most errors. Indentation defines the structure and relationships between elements.

- Always use spaces, never tabs. The standard is 2 spaces per level of indentation.
- Items at the same level of indentation are "siblings" (equal partners).
- An item indented under another is its "child" (a property of the parent).

```yaml
# CORRECT ‚úÖ
- kind: Question
  id: question_captureInitialIdea
  interruptionPolicy:
    allowInterruption: true
  variable: init:Global.InitialIdea
  entity: StringPrebuiltEntity
```

### Rule 2: The Core Building Blocks: Key-Value Pairs
Everything in YAML is a pair of a key and a value, separated by a colon and a space (key: value). The `kind` key is special, as it tells the platform what kind of component you are defining.

```yaml
kind: SendActivity
id: sendActivity_Welcome
activity: "Welcome to the bot!"
```

### Rule 3: Lists of Actions
Your bot's conversation is a list of actions that happen in order. In YAML, a list item starts with a hyphen and a space (`- `). The `actions:` key always introduces a list of these action blocks.

```yaml
# Correct structure for Copilot Studio
kind: AdaptiveDialog
beginDialog:
  kind: OnUnknownIntent
  id: main
  actions:
    # Action 1
    - kind: SendActivity
      id: sendActivity_Welcome
      activity: "Welcome!"

    # Action 2
    - kind: Question
      id: question_askName
      interruptionPolicy:
        allowInterruption: true
      variable: init:Global.UserName
      entity: StringPrebuiltEntity
      prompt: "What is your name?"
```

## Part 2: The Brains - Variables and Logic

### Rule 4: The Bot's Memory: Variables üß†
Variables are how your bot remembers information. Choosing the right type is crucial.

| Variable Type | Scope | Use Case |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| Global.VariableName | Entire User Session | Long-term memory. Use this to pass information between different topics. |
| Topic.VariableName | Current Topic Only | Short-term memory for a single conversational task. It's forgotten once the topic ends. |
| Dialog.VariableName | Internal Processing | Temporary memory for a single turn or a looping dialog. Not meant for passing data between major topics. |

**CRITICAL: The `init:` Prefix Rule**
In Copilot Studio, **ALL variables used in Question actions MUST have the `init:` prefix**. This is mandatory and cannot be substituted with SetVariable initialization.

```yaml
# CORRECT ‚úÖ - Using init: prefix in Questions (REQUIRED)
- kind: Question
  id: question_captureAgentIdea
  interruptionPolicy:
    allowInterruption: true
  variable: init:Global.AgentIdea
  prompt: "What's your agent idea?"
  entity: StringPrebuiltEntity

# WRONG ‚ùå - Missing init: prefix causes questions to be silently skipped
- kind: Question
  id: question_captureAgentIdea
  interruptionPolicy:
    allowInterruption: true
  variable: Global.AgentIdea          # Missing init: = SKIPPED QUESTION!
  prompt: "What's your agent idea?"
  entity: StringPrebuiltEntity

# ALSO WRONG ‚ùå - SetVariable cannot substitute for init: in Questions
- kind: SetVariable
  id: setVariable_initAgentIdea
  variable: Global.AgentIdea
  value: ""

- kind: Question
  id: question_captureAgentIdea
  interruptionPolicy:
    allowInterruption: true
  variable: Global.AgentIdea          # Still missing init: = STILL SKIPPED!
  prompt: "What's your agent idea?"
  entity: StringPrebuiltEntity
```

**Variable Rules:**
- **Always use `init:` prefix in Question actions** - This is mandatory for questions to work
- **Both Global and Topic scopes work** - `init:Global.Name` and `init:Topic.Name` are both valid
- **SetVariable cannot substitute for init:** - Even pre-initialized variables need the init: prefix in Questions
- **Use SetVariable for non-Question logic** - For calculations, concatenations, and conditional assignments

### Rule 5: Question Actions Structure - Complete Requirements
**CRITICAL**: Every Question action MUST have four required properties:

1. `interruptionPolicy:` with `allowInterruption: true` - Without this, questions are skipped
2. `variable:` with `init:` prefix - Where to store the response
3. `entity:` - What type of input to expect (lowercase!)
4. `prompt:` - What to ask the user

```yaml
# CORRECT ‚úÖ - Complete Question template
- kind: Question
  id: question_getName
  interruptionPolicy:
    allowInterruption: true
  variable: init:Global.UserName      # Required: init: prefix
  entity: StringPrebuiltEntity        # Required: lowercase 'entity:'
  prompt: "What's your name?"         # Required: what to ask

# WRONG ‚ùå - Missing interruptionPolicy (question gets skipped)
- kind: Question
  id: question_getName
  variable: init:Global.UserName
  entity: StringPrebuiltEntity
  prompt: "What's your name?"

# WRONG ‚ùå - Wrong capitalization of entity
- kind: Question
  id: question_getName
  interruptionPolicy:
    allowInterruption: true
  variable: init:Global.UserName
  Entity: StringPrebuiltEntity        # Wrong! Should be lowercase 'entity:'
  prompt: "What's your name?"
```

**Complete List of Valid Entities from Copilot Studio:**
```
StringPrebuiltEntity, BooleanPrebuiltEntity, NumberPrebuiltEntity, 
DateTimePrebuiltEntity, EmailPrebuiltEntity, URLPrebuiltEntity,
PhoneNumberPrebuiltEntity, PersonNamePrebuiltEntity, 
OrganizationPrebuiltEntity, CityPrebuiltEntity, 
CountryOrRegionPrebuiltEntity, StatePrebuiltEntity,
StreetAddressPrebuiltEntity, ZipCodePrebuiltEntity,
MoneyPrebuiltEntity, PercentagePrebuiltEntity, 
TemperaturePrebuiltEntity, WeightPrebuiltEntity,
SpeedPrebuiltEntity, AgePrebuiltEntity, ColorPrebuiltEntity,
ContinentPrebuiltEntity, DatePrebuiltEntity,
DateTimeNoTimeZonePrebuiltEntity, DurationPrebuiltEntity,
EventPrebuiltEntity, FilePrebuiltEntity, LanguagePrebuiltEntity,
OrdinalPrebuiltEntity, PointOfInterestPrebuiltEntity
```

### Rule 6: The Logic Engine: Power Fx Formulas
Whenever you see `value: =`, the text that follows is a Power Fx formula.

**Text Concatenation**: Use `Concatenate()` function, NOT the `&` operator.

```yaml
# CORRECT ‚úÖ
value: =Concatenate("Hello, ", Global.UserName, "!")

# WRONG ‚ùå - & operator not supported in Copilot Studio
value: ="Hello, " & Global.UserName & "!"
```

**Line Breaks**: Use `Char(10)` for line breaks in Power Fx formulas.

```yaml
# CORRECT ‚úÖ
value: =Concatenate("Line 1", Char(10), "Line 2")

# WRONG ‚ùå
value: ="Line 1\nLine 2"
```

**Displaying Variables in Messages**: Use curly braces (`{}`) in prompt and SendActivity blocks.

```yaml
prompt: "Hello, {Global.UserName}!"
```

**Multi-line Text**: For long prompts, use the pipe symbol (`|`) and a hyphen (`-`).

```yaml
prompt: |-
  Here is your summary:
  **Name:** {Global.AgentName}
  **Status:** {Global.AgentStatus}
```

## Part 3: Troubleshooting Common Errors (Updated with Current Knowledge)

### Error 1: Questions Being Silently Skipped (Most Common Issue)
**Root Cause**: Missing required properties in Question actions.

**The Complete Fix - Use This Exact Template:**
```yaml
# REQUIRED TEMPLATE ‚úÖ - Use this for ALL Questions
- kind: Question
  id: question_DescriptiveName
  interruptionPolicy:
    allowInterruption: true
  variable: init:Global.VariableName    # or init:Topic.VariableName
  prompt: "Your question text here"
  entity: StringPrebuiltEntity
```

**Common Causes of Skipped Questions:**
- Missing `interruptionPolicy` block
- Missing `init:` prefix in variable
- Wrong capitalization of `entity` (must be lowercase)
- Using SetVariable instead of `init:` prefix

### Error 2: "Unknown element at path Triggers[0]" 
**Root Cause**: Using incorrect dialog structure.

**The Correct Structure for Copilot Studio:**
```yaml
# CORRECT ‚úÖ - Using beginDialog structure (what actually works)
kind: AdaptiveDialog
beginDialog:
  kind: OnUnknownIntent
  id: main
  actions:
    # ... your actions here
```

**Valid Trigger Kinds:**
- `OnUnknownIntent` - Most reliable for general-purpose bots that respond to any user input
- `OnConversationStart` - For initial greetings (may not work reliably in all contexts)
- `OnRecognizedIntent` - When you have specific trigger phrases with `triggerQueries`

### Error 3: "Unknown element at path BeginDialog.Actions.Actions[X].Entity"
**Root Cause**: Incorrect capitalization or invalid entity type.

**The Most Common Cause - Wrong Capitalization:**
```yaml
# WRONG ‚ùå - Capital 'E' in Entity
- kind: Question
  id: question_getName
  interruptionPolicy:
    allowInterruption: true
  variable: init:Global.UserName
  Entity: StringPrebuiltEntity        # Should be lowercase!
  prompt: "What's your name?"

# CORRECT ‚úÖ - Lowercase 'entity'
- kind: Question
  id: question_getName
  interruptionPolicy:
    allowInterruption: true
  variable: init:Global.UserName
  entity: StringPrebuiltEntity        # Correct lowercase
  prompt: "What's your name?"
```

### Error 4: BooleanPrebuiltEntity Issues (Updated Understanding)
**Previous Issue**: BooleanPrebuiltEntity was thought to be unreliable with natural language.

**Current Reality**: With correct syntax (init: prefix and interruptionPolicy), BooleanPrebuiltEntity works reliably for clear yes/no questions.

```yaml
# WORKS RELIABLY ‚úÖ - With correct syntax
- kind: Question
  id: question_Confirmation
  interruptionPolicy:
    allowInterruption: true
  variable: init:Global.IsConfirmed
  prompt: "Do you want to continue? (Please answer Yes or No)"
  entity: BooleanPrebuiltEntity

# For more flexible responses, still prefer StringPrebuiltEntity with conditions
- kind: Question
  id: question_FlexibleConfirmation
  interruptionPolicy:
    allowInterruption: true
  variable: init:Global.ConfirmationText
  prompt: "Do you want to continue? Please let me know."
  entity: StringPrebuiltEntity

- kind: ConditionGroup
  conditions:
    - id: condition_IsPositive
      condition: =Or(Find("yes", Lower(Global.ConfirmationText)) > 0, Find("continue", Lower(Global.ConfirmationText)) > 0, Find("proceed", Lower(Global.ConfirmationText)) > 0)
```

### Error 5: "UnexpectedToken near line X" - YAML Formatting
**Root Cause**: YAML formatting issues - missing quotes, wrong indentation, or malformed strings.

**Common Fixes:**
- Ensure all string values with special characters are quoted
- Check indentation is exactly 2 spaces per level  
- Verify all list items start with `- ` (hyphen + space)
- Use `|` or `|-` for multi-line strings instead of complex concatenation

```yaml
# WRONG ‚ùå - Unquoted strings with special characters
activity: Welcome! Let's create your agent: it'll be great

# CORRECT ‚úÖ - Quoted strings
activity: "Welcome! Let's create your agent: it'll be great"

# WRONG ‚ùå - Bad indentation
actions:
- kind: SendActivity
  id: test

# CORRECT ‚úÖ - Proper 2-space indentation
actions:
  - kind: SendActivity
    id: test
```

### Error 6: Power Fx Display Issues
**Root Cause**: Complex Power Fx formulas in SendActivity not displaying properly.

**Solution**: Use `{VariableName}` syntax in activity text instead of complex formulas.

```yaml
# AVOID ‚ùå - Complex Power Fx in activities can display as raw formulas
activity: =Concatenate("Hello ", Global.UserName, ", your agent: ", Global.AgentName)

# PREFER ‚úÖ - Variable substitution with curly braces
activity: "Hello {Global.UserName}, your agent: {Global.AgentName}"

# Or use SetVariable first for complex formulas
- kind: SetVariable
  id: setVariable_CreateMessage
  variable: Global.WelcomeMessage
  value: =Concatenate("Hello ", Global.UserName, ", your agent: ", Global.AgentName)

- kind: SendActivity
  id: sendActivity_ShowMessage
  activity: "{Global.WelcomeMessage}"
```

### Error 7: Conditional Logic Requirements
**CRITICAL**: Every condition in a `ConditionGroup` MUST have an `id` property.

```yaml
# CORRECT ‚úÖ
- kind: ConditionGroup
  id: if_IsNewIdea
  conditions:
    - id: condition_IsIdea              # Required id!
      condition: =Find("idea", Lower(Global.AgentStatus)) > 0
      actions:
        # ... actions if true
  defaultActions:
    # ... actions if false or no conditions match

# WRONG ‚ùå - Missing condition id
- kind: ConditionGroup
  id: if_IsNewIdea
  conditions:
    - condition: =Find("idea", Lower(Global.AgentStatus)) > 0  # Missing id!
      actions:
        # ... actions if true
```

### Error 8: AnswerQuestionWithAI Automatic Display Issue (Common)
**Root Cause**: AnswerQuestionWithAI automatically displays its response immediately after execution, which causes duplication if you try to display the response manually.

**The Problem**: This creates duplicate messages that confuse users.

```yaml
# WRONG ‚ùå - Causes duplicate display
- kind: AnswerQuestionWithAI
  id: ai_GenerateResponse
  variable: Global.AIResponse
  userInput: =Global.UserInput
  question: "Generate a helpful response about this topic."

# This creates a duplicate! The AI already displayed above
- kind: SendActivity
  id: sendActivity_ShowAI
  activity: "Here's my response: {Global.AIResponse}"

# CORRECT ‚úÖ - Let AI display automatically, no manual display needed
- kind: AnswerQuestionWithAI
  id: ai_GenerateResponse
  variable: Global.AIResponse
  userInput: =Global.UserInput
  question: "Generate a helpful response about this topic."

# Continue directly to next action - AI response appears automatically above
- kind: Question
  id: question_NextStep
  interruptionPolicy:
    allowInterruption: true
  variable: init:Global.NextInput
  prompt: "What would you like to do next?"
  entity: StringPrebuiltEntity
```

**Key Points about AnswerQuestionWithAI:**
- **Always displays response immediately** - cannot be suppressed
- **Store response in variable** for potential use in logic, but don't display manually
- **No way to prevent automatic display** - this is intended behavior
- **Plan conversation flow accordingly** - next Question/SendActivity comes after AI response appears

## Part 4: Best Practices (Updated)

### Practice 1: Use the Complete Question Template
Always use this exact template for reliable Question actions:

```yaml
- kind: Question
  id: question_DescriptiveName
  interruptionPolicy:
    allowInterruption: true
  variable: init:Global.VariableName  # or init:Topic.VariableName
  prompt: "Clear, specific question text"
  entity: StringPrebuiltEntity        # Choose appropriate entity type
```

### Practice 2: Smart Entity Selection
Choose entity types based on real user behavior and question clarity:

```yaml
# For clear yes/no questions - BooleanPrebuiltEntity works well
- kind: Question
  id: question_SimpleConfirmation
  interruptionPolicy:
    allowInterruption: true
  variable: init:Global.IsConfirmed
  prompt: "Do you want to continue? (Please answer Yes or No)"
  entity: BooleanPrebuiltEntity

# For flexible responses - use StringPrebuiltEntity with smart parsing
- kind: Question
  id: question_FlexibleInput
  interruptionPolicy:
    allowInterruption: true
  variable: init:Global.UserResponse
  prompt: "Tell me about your requirements:"
  entity: StringPrebuiltEntity
```

### Practice 3: Simple and Predictable Flow Design
**The most common source of logical errors is trying to be too clever with conversation flow.** While features like GotoAction exist, they are unreliable for major jumps. The most stable and predictable structure is a simple "waterfall" that uses nested ConditionGroup blocks.

This often means you will have to repeat sections of your logic. While this makes the YAML file longer, it makes the bot's behavior predictable and easy to debug.

**Remember: A long, simple, predictable file is better than a short, clever, broken one.**

```yaml
# UNRELIABLE ‚ùå - Trying to jump to shared sections
- kind: ConditionGroup
  conditions:
    - id: condition_isPathA
      actions:
        # ... do Path A logic ...
        - kind: GotoAction
          actionId: shared_logic  # RISKY JUMP

# ROBUST ‚úÖ - Duplicate logic within each path
- kind: ConditionGroup
  conditions:
    - id: condition_isPathA
      actions:
        # ... do Path A logic ...
        # --- DUPLICATED BUT RELIABLE LOGIC ---
        - kind: Question
          id: question_PathASpecific
          interruptionPolicy:
            allowInterruption: true
          variable: init:Global.PathAData
          prompt: "Path A specific question"
          entity: StringPrebuiltEntity
  defaultActions:
    # ... do Path B logic ...
    # --- DUPLICATED BUT RELIABLE LOGIC ---
    - kind: Question
      id: question_PathBSpecific
      interruptionPolicy:
        allowInterruption: true
      variable: init:Global.PathBData
      prompt: "Path B specific question"
      entity: StringPrebuiltEntity
```

### Practice 4: Incremental Testing Strategy
Build your bot step by step:
1. Start with basic welcome message and one question
2. Test each question individually before adding the next
3. Add conditional logic only after all questions work
4. Test each branch separately

This approach helps identify exactly where errors occur.

### Practice 5: Consistent Naming Convention
Use descriptive, consistent IDs:

```yaml
# Good naming patterns
- kind: Question
  id: question_GetUserName          # Clear purpose

- kind: SetVariable
  id: setVariable_InitUserData      # Clear action

- kind: ConditionGroup
  id: if_UserIsRegistered           # Clear condition
  conditions:
    - id: condition_IsRegistered    # Clear condition name
```

## Part 5: Supported vs Unsupported Features (Updated)

### ‚úÖ Fully Supported and Reliable
- **SendActivity** - Send messages to users
- **Question** - Ask for user input (with correct syntax)
- **SetVariable** - Store and manipulate values
- **ConditionGroup** - If/else logic with proper structure
- **BeginDialog** - Call other topics
- **EndDialog** - End conversation cleanly
- **BooleanPrebuiltEntity** - Works reliably with correct syntax
- **StringPrebuiltEntity** - Most versatile for user input
- **NumberPrebuiltEntity** - Numeric input validation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Use With Caution
- **GotoAction** - Only for simple loops back to recent questions, unreliable for complex flow control
- **AnswerQuestionWithAI** - Good for conversational content generation, BUT automatically displays responses (see Error 8)
- **Dialog scope variables** - Can cause recognition errors, prefer Global or Topic scope

### ‚ùå Unsupported or Unreliable
- **Complex GotoAction flows** - Causes silent failures and unpredictable behavior
- **`DoWhile` loops** - Not supported in Copilot Studio
- **Complex Power Fx table operations** - Often cause errors, use simple string concatenation instead
- **Questions without `init:` prefix** - Will be silently skipped
- **Questions without `interruptionPolicy`** - Will be silently skipped
- **Using SetVariable as substitute for `init:`** - Does not work

## Part 6: Working Examples

### Complete Minimal Bot
```yaml
kind: AdaptiveDialog
beginDialog:
  kind: OnUnknownIntent
  id: main
  actions:
    - kind: SendActivity
      id: sendActivity_Welcome
      activity: "Welcome to our bot!"

    - kind: Question
      id: question_GetName
      interruptionPolicy:
        allowInterruption: true
      variable: init:Global.UserName
      prompt: "What's your name?"
      entity: StringPrebuiltEntity

    - kind: Question
      id: question_GetAge
      interruptionPolicy:
        allowInterruption: true
      variable: init:Global.UserAge
      prompt: "How old are you?"
      entity: NumberPrebuiltEntity

    - kind: SendActivity
      id: sendActivity_Summary
      activity: "Nice to meet you, {Global.UserName}! You are {Global.UserAge} years old."

    - kind: EndDialog
      id: endDialog_Complete
```

### Conditional Logic Example
```yaml
kind: AdaptiveDialog
beginDialog:
  kind: OnUnknownIntent
  id: main
  actions:
    - kind: Question
      id: question_GetPreference
      interruptionPolicy:
        allowInterruption: true
      variable: init:Global.UserPreference
      prompt: "Do you prefer cats or dogs?"
      entity: StringPrebuiltEntity

    - kind: ConditionGroup
      id: if_LikesCats
      conditions:
        - id: condition_CatLover
          condition: =Find("cat", Lower(Global.UserPreference)) > 0
          actions:
            - kind: SendActivity
              id: sendActivity_CatResponse
              activity: "Great! Cats are wonderful companions! üê±"
        - id: condition_DogLover
          condition: =Find("dog", Lower(Global.UserPreference)) > 0
          actions:
            - kind: SendActivity
              id: sendActivity_DogResponse
              activity: "Awesome! Dogs are amazing friends! üêï"
      defaultActions:
        - kind: SendActivity
          id: sendActivity_NeutralResponse
          activity: "Both cats and dogs make great pets!"

    - kind: EndDialog
      id: endDialog_Complete
```

### Data Collection Example
```yaml
kind: AdaptiveDialog
beginDialog:
  kind: OnUnknownIntent
  id: main
  actions:
    - kind: Question
      id: question_GetName
      interruptionPolicy:
        allowInterruption: true
      variable: init:Global.CustomerName
      prompt: "What's your name?"
      entity: StringPrebuiltEntity

    - kind: Question
      id: question_GetEmail
      interruptionPolicy:
        allowInterruption: true
      variable: init:Global.CustomerEmail
      prompt: "What's your email address?"
      entity: EmailPrebuiltEntity

    - kind: Question
      id: question_GetFeedback
      interruptionPolicy:
        allowInterruption: true
      variable: init:Global.CustomerFeedback
      prompt: "Please share your feedback about our service:"
      entity: StringPrebuiltEntity

    # Build summary
    - kind: SetVariable
      id: setVariable_CreateSummary
      variable: Global.CustomerSummary
      value: =Concatenate("Customer: ", Global.CustomerName, Char(10), "Email: ", Global.CustomerEmail, Char(10), "Feedback: ", Global.CustomerFeedback)

    - kind: SendActivity
      id: sendActivity_ShowSummary
      activity: |-
        Thank you for your feedback! Here's what we received:

        {Global.CustomerSummary}

    - kind: EndDialog
      id: endDialog_Complete
```

## Part 7: Critical Reminders for Success

1. **ALWAYS use the complete Question template** - Missing any required property causes silent failures
2. **NEVER skip the `init:` prefix** - Questions without it will be skipped entirely  
3. **ALWAYS include `interruptionPolicy`** - Questions without it will be skipped entirely
4. **Use lowercase `entity:`** - Capital E causes "Unknown element" errors
5. **Test incrementally** - Add one question at a time and test before continuing
6. **Keep flows simple and predictable** - Duplicate logic rather than using complex jumps
7. **Use `{VariableName}` in activities** - Avoid complex Power Fx formulas in display text
8. **Every condition needs an `id`** - Missing condition IDs cause errors

## Part 8: Debugging Checklist

When your bot isn't working:

**Questions being skipped?**
- ‚úÖ Check for `interruptionPolicy` block
- ‚úÖ Check for `init:` prefix in variable
- ‚úÖ Check `entity:` is lowercase
- ‚úÖ Check all required properties are present

**Getting "Unknown element" errors?**
- ‚úÖ Check YAML indentation (exactly 2 spaces per level)
- ‚úÖ Check entity names are spelled correctly
- ‚úÖ Check condition IDs are present
- ‚úÖ Check for proper quotes around strings with special characters

**Conditional logic not working?**
- ‚úÖ Check every condition has an `id` property
- ‚úÖ Check Power Fx syntax in conditions
- ‚úÖ Check `defaultActions` is present for fallback behavior
- ‚úÖ Test each condition branch separately

**Variables not displaying?**
- ‚úÖ Use `{VariableName}` syntax in activity text
- ‚úÖ Check variable names match exactly (case sensitive)
- ‚úÖ Avoid complex Power Fx formulas in SendActivity

**Bot behavior unpredictable?**
- ‚úÖ Avoid complex GotoAction flows
- ‚úÖ Use simple waterfall structure with nested conditions
- ‚úÖ Test each section independently
- ‚úÖ Keep logic within single ConditionGroup blocks when possible

This guide reflects the current, tested, and verified syntax for Copilot Studio as of September 2024. Following these patterns will result in reliable, predictable bot behavior.

# Guide Updates - New Discoveries from Testing

## Part 8: Advanced Troubleshooting (Updated from Real-World Testing)

### Critical Discovery: ConditionGroup Reliability Issues

**Problem**: ConditionGroup actions may not work reliably in all Copilot Studio environments.

**Symptoms**:
- Bot execution stops after SetVariable actions
- Questions are skipped entirely
- ConditionGroup conditions appear to evaluate but actions don't execute
- No error messages, just silent failure

**Root Cause**: Environmental compatibility issues with ConditionGroup in certain Copilot Studio deployments.

**Solutions**:
1. **Use separate topics instead of complex ConditionGroup logic**
2. **Implement linear flows with conditional prompts** (but see limitations below)
3. **Test ConditionGroup thoroughly in your specific environment before deploying**

### Power Fx Formula Limitations in Text Fields

**Critical Discovery**: Power Fx formulas (=If(), =Concatenate(), etc.) work in `value:` fields but NOT in `activity:` or `prompt:` fields in some environments.

**Problem Symptoms**:
```yaml
# This displays as raw text instead of executing
prompt: =If(Global.PathType = "BUILT", "Built question", "Skip")
# User sees: "=If(Global.PathType = "BUILT", "Built question", "Skip")"
```

**Working Solution**:
```yaml
# Use SetVariable to create conditional text first
- kind: SetVariable
  id: setVariable_CreatePrompt
  variable: Global.DynamicPrompt
  value: =If(Global.PathType = "BUILT", "Built question", "Skip")

# Then use variable substitution
- kind: Question
  prompt: "{Global.DynamicPrompt}"
```

**Alternative**: Use static text and ConditionGroup branching (if ConditionGroup works in your environment).

### Teams Message and Dataverse Integration

**Tested Pattern for External System Integration**:

```yaml
# 1. Populate variables first
- kind: SetVariable
  id: setVariable_SetDataverseField
  variable: Topic.copis_agentname
  value: =Global.AgentName

# 2. Call external systems with input parameters
- kind: BeginDialog
  id: beginDialog_CallExternal
  input:
    fieldName: =Topic.copis_agentname
  dialog: your.action.ExternalSystem
  output:
    binding:
      result: Topic.result
```

**Key Requirements**:
- Use `input:` section to pass data to external actions
- Use `output: binding:` to capture returned data
- Dataverse choice fields require numeric values (e.g., 586220000, not strings)

### Variable Extraction from AI Responses

**Problem**: AI-generated text often includes conversational elements that break variable extraction.

**Tested Solution**:
```yaml
# Give AI very specific formatting instructions
question: |-
  Create the final agent name and summary. Do NOT ask any questions. Just provide exactly this:
  
  **Agent Name:** [Professional name in 2-4 words]
  
  **Agent Summary:** [Detailed description]
  
  Format exactly as shown. Do not add anything else.

# Then extract with error handling
- kind: SetVariable
  id: setVariable_ExtractName
  variable: Global.AgentName
  value: =If(Find("**Agent Name:**", Global.AIOutput) > 0, Trim(Mid(Global.AIOutput, Find("**Agent Name:**", Global.AIOutput) + 15, 50)), "Default Name")
```

### Multi-Topic Architecture Best Practices

**Discovery**: Complex single-topic flows are unreliable. Separate topics work better.

**Recommended Architecture**:
```
MainRouter ‚Üí IdeaFlow OR BuiltFlow ‚Üí SourcesCollection ‚Üí FinalApproval
```

**Each topic should**:
- Have a single, focused responsibility
- Use OnUnknownIntent as trigger type
- Call next topic with BeginDialog
- Handle its own error states

### AnswerQuestionWithAI Updated Behavior

**Confirmed**: AnswerQuestionWithAI always displays its response automatically. There is no way to suppress this.

**Best Practice**:
```yaml
# ‚úÖ Correct - let AI display automatically
- kind: AnswerQuestionWithAI
  id: ai_Generate
  variable: Global.AIResponse
  question: "Generate content..."

# Continue directly to next action
- kind: Question
  id: question_Next
  prompt: "What's next?"

# ‚ùå Wrong - creates duplicate
- kind: SendActivity
  activity: "{Global.AIResponse}"  # Don't do this!
```

## Part 9: Environment-Specific Testing Checklist

Before deploying complex flows, test these specific patterns in your environment:

### Test 1: ConditionGroup Functionality
```yaml
- kind: SetVariable
  variable: Global.TestValue
  value: "TEST"

- kind: ConditionGroup
  conditions:
    - id: condition_Test
      condition: =Global.TestValue = "TEST"
      actions:
        - kind: SendActivity
          activity: "ConditionGroup works!"
  defaultActions:
    - kind: SendActivity
      activity: "ConditionGroup failed!"
```

**Expected**: Shows "ConditionGroup works!"
**If Failed**: Use separate topics instead

### Test 2: Power Fx in Text Fields
```yaml
- kind: SetVariable
  variable: Global.TestText
  value: "Dynamic"

- kind: SendActivity
  activity: =Concatenate("This is ", Global.TestText, " text")
```

**Expected**: Shows "This is Dynamic text"
**If Failed**: Shows raw formula - use variable substitution instead

### Test 3: BeginDialog Between Topics
```yaml
# In Topic A
- kind: BeginDialog
  dialog: TopicB

# Topic B should execute and return to Topic A
```

**Expected**: Topic B executes, returns to Topic A
**If Failed**: Check topic names and trigger types

## Part 10: Production Deployment Guidelines

### Staging Environment Testing
1. Test each topic individually before connecting them
2. Test complete flows with real user scenarios  
3. Verify external system integrations (Dataverse, Teams)
4. Test error conditions and fallback paths

### Performance Considerations
- Limit AnswerQuestionWithAI calls (they add latency)
- Use simple variable operations over complex Power Fx
- Minimize topic-to-topic calls where possible

### Monitoring and Debugging
- Add strategic SendActivity debugging messages during development
- Remove debug messages before production
- Test with various input patterns (edge cases, unexpected responses)
- Verify Global variables persist correctly across topic calls

## Summary of Major Guide Corrections

1. **ConditionGroup**: Not reliable in all environments - test thoroughly
2. **Power Fx in text fields**: May display as raw formulas - use variables instead  
3. **AnswerQuestionWithAI**: Always displays automatically - don't duplicate

### AnswerQuestionWithAI Formatting Compliance Issues

**Problem**: AI consistently ignores formatting instructions and adds unwanted content (questions, offers to help, suggestions) even with explicit instructions not to.

**Symptoms**:
- AI outputs full conversational responses instead of requested format
- Extraction logic fails because expected markers aren't found
- Variables contain entire AI responses including questions

**Example of the Problem**:
```yaml
# Even with explicit instructions like this:
question: |-
  Output ONLY these two items:
  **Agent Name:** [name]
  **Agent Summary:** [summary]
  NO QUESTIONS. NO OFFERS. NOTHING ELSE.

# AI still outputs:
# "How about naming your agent BirthdayBuddy? 
#  Would you like me to help you outline how it works?"
Solutions:

Avoid AI for Structured Data Generation

yaml   # Instead of relying on AI to format correctly, use Power Fx
   - kind: SetVariable
     id: setVariable_GenerateName
     variable: Global.AgentName
     value: =If(Find("birthday", Lower(Global.UserDescription)) > 0, "Birthday Reminder Agent", "Custom Process Agent")

Give Users Direct Control

yaml   # Let users provide the exact text they want
   - kind: Question
     id: question_GetName
     interruptionPolicy:
       allowInterruption: true
     variable: init:Global.NewName
     prompt: What would you like to name your agent?
     entity: StringPrebuiltEntity

Use Multiple Narrow AI Calls

yaml   # Break complex requests into simple, specific ones
   - kind: AnswerQuestionWithAI
     id: ai_OnlyName
     variable: Global.RawName
     question: |-
       Output ONLY a 2-4 word agent name.
       Examples: Birthday Bot, Email Assistant
       JUST THE NAME. NOTHING ELSE.

Accept AI Limitations

Design flows that work even if AI adds extra content
Use extraction logic that's resilient to variations
Provide clear user controls to override AI suggestions




This addition would help others who encounter the same frustrating issue where AnswerQuestionWithAI ignores formatting instructions. The key insight is that sometimes it's better to work around AI limitations rather than trying to force compliance with complex instructions.

Would you like me to format this as a complete addition to your guide, or would you prefer to add it yourself?
4. **Multi-topic architecture**: More reliable than complex single-topic flows
5. **External integrations**: Use input/output parameters, not just Global variables

These discoveries came from extensive real-world testing and should be incorporated into the main guide to prevent others from encountering the same issues.
